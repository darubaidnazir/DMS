        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offering the B.Tech (CSE) programme was established in the year 2009. It can be regarded as one of the first engineering departments conceived by the University of Kashmir. Although started with limited facilities, the department has made notable growth in all respects over the last few years. This includes development of labs, procurement of equipment, books and furniture, which has consolidated the department to provide just the right environment for young students pursuing the engineering degree in computer sciences.

          One of the biggest advantages of the department is the strength of permanent faculty members. With six assistant professors assisted by as many contractual teachers, the department strives to maintain highest academic standards by putting in place best practices for ensuring smooth and efficient functioning of academics. Teaching-learning is systematic with an up-to-date curriculum. The major focus remains towards laboratory experiments and hands-on learning. Quality is stressed though standard mechanisms of monitoring and student feedback.
          
          We believe in overall development of students and hence prime importance is given to student mentoring through regular counselling and interactions. Many batches have passed out with a significant number of students being absorbed in reputed industries and many others pursuing higher degrees like Ph.D in foreign universities.
          
          We have recently conceived an innovative program called ‘Achievers Meet Aspirers’, which consists of guest lectures and interactive sessions by passed out students of our own department currently employed in the corporate IT sector. This is aimed at providing exposure and motivation to our graduating students. This year (2021), the department took a big step towards expansion with the commencement of M. Tech CSE programme which will provide great opportunity to candidates to pursue the said degree which is not yet offered in any other institution of the valley.
